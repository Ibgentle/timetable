# timetable
A Python-tkinter program to generate a timetable for call agents in an emergency communication center.
Agents have been divided into two groups, and both groups must alternate the shifts Monday to Wednesday.
From Thursday to Sunday, agents take turns to go off in a manner that whoever is to be off on a day, 
  will work the morning shift of the day before and resume the afternoon shift of the day after the off day.
An equal number agents must go off in both groups so that every agent would have taken a day off before
  the cycle is repeated the following week.
